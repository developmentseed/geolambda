# Python GeoLambda

The Python GeoLambda image is meant to be used as a template for your own Python based geospatial project.  Follow the usage instructions to package, test, and deploy your own Lambda.

## Usage

These instructions show how to use the files in this directory to create your own Python based geospatial Lambda function and get it deployed.

**1. Update requirements**

First a Docker image will need to be created based on GeoLambda that includes the dependencies needed. The first thing is to is update the `requirements-pre.txt` and `requirement.txt` files with the dependencies needed. The `requirements-pre.txt` is a way to specify build dependencies to packages in `requirements.txt`. For instance, rasterio requires numpy is installed before rasterio. This is a well known pip problem that is fixed in [PEP 518](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0518/) but is not used by all packages so this work-around is needed.

**2. Create handler**

An example Lambda handler is located at [lambda/lambda_function.py](lambda/lambda_function.py). Ideally most of the logic in your Lambda should be in packages and the handler should only be responsible for taking in an event, calling relevant functions, and returning some output. Keep the handler code as small as possible. Move more complex code into packages or make them other functions in the [lambda/lambda_function.py](lambda/lambda_function.py) file.

**3. Build image**

Now, use the [Dockerfile](Dockerfile) can be used to create a new Docker image based on any version of GeoLambda with any version of Python by providing the versions as build arguments to `docker run`. This will install the specified version of Python along with any Python packages provided in [requirements.txt](requirements.txt).

```
$ VERSION=1.2.0
$ docker build . --build-arg VERSION=${VERSION} --build-arg PYVERSION=3.7.3 -t <myimage>:latest
```

If not provided, `VERSION` (the version of GeoLambda to use) will default to `latest` and `PYVERSION` (Python version) will default to `3.7.3`.

**4. Set up development environment and lambda layer zip file**

First you'll need to build a `geolambda` base layer, and then you'll have to build `geolambda-python` layer located in `python/` directory.

All that's needed to create a development package is to install the Python packages into the `python/lambda/` directory using the `package-python.sh` script. This copies the installed site-packages over the lambda directory, but excluding some libraries since they won't be needed. This includes packages that are already pre-installed in Lambda like boto3, as well as files and libraries that wouldn't be used operationally (e.g., testing files).

This will create geolambda base layer (`lambda-deploy.zip`) file and `/geolambda/lambda` directory needed for development.

```
# current dir: geolambda (up one level)

$ docker run --rm -v $PWD:/home/geolambda -it developmentseed/geolambda:${VERSION} package.sh
```

This will copy site-packages in /geolambda/python/lambda directory needed for development. Also, it will create a `lambda-layer-deploy.zip` file in the current directory. 
Contents of the zip file are following AWS conventions: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-layers.html#configuration-layers-path

```
# current dir: geolambda/python

$ docker run -v ${PWD}:/home/geolambda -t <myimage>:latest package-python.sh
```

**5. Testing deployment package**

You can use the [LambCI Docker images](https://github.com/lambci/docker-lambda) to test out your handler in the Lambda environment by mounting the base GeoLambda Lambda layer (`/geolambda/lambda`) and the lambda directory (`/geolambda/python/lambda`) created above.

```
# current dir: geolambda/python

$ docker run --rm -v ${PWD}/lambda:/var/task -v ${PWD}/../lambda:/opt lambci/lambda:python3.7 lambda_function.lambda_handler '{}'
```

The last argument is a JSON string that will be passed as the event payload to the handler function.

**6. Deploy as Lambda layer (if layer already exists a new version will be created)**

Deploy the Lambda layer by using AWS CLI.

```
$ aws lambda publish-layer-version \
	--layer-name geolambda-python37 \
	--description "Python bindings for GDAL" \
	--zip-file fileb://lambda-layer-deploy.zip
```

### Pre-built images

Builds of this default Python image are also available on Docker Hub as tags in the `developmentseed/geolambda` repository.

    $ docker pull developmentseed/geolambda:${VERSION}-python37

To run the image interactively:

    $ docker run -v ${PWD}:/home/geolambda --rm -it developmentseed/geolambda:${VERSION}-python37

This image includes the dependencies specified in the default [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) file.


## Development

To create a new official version of a Python GeoLambda Docker image for publication to Docker Hub follow these steps *after* following the [steps for publishing a new base GeoLambda](../README.md). These steps are performed automatically in [CircleCI](../.circleci/config.yml)

From this directory:

```
$ VERSION=$(cat ../VERSION)
$ docker build . --build-arg VERSION=${VERSION} -t developmentseed/geolambda:${VERSION}-python37
```

Provide `--build-arg PYVERSION=X.Y.Z` to build other Python versions and change the tag to be `${VERSION}-pythonX.Y`
